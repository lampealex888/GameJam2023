  - dialogue: "Every Saturday morning when I come to visit, Grandpa and I would have
      a toasted everything bagel with cream cheese. I never used to like cream cheese
      until Grandpa told me to try it. It was his favorite food of all time. When
      I find him, I\u2019m gonna make him a million bagels with pounds of cream cheese
      on top!"
