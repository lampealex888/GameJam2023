  - dialogue: Oh hey, this is the science fiction section of the library. Science
      fiction was my grandpa's favorite.
    speaker: Carl
  - dialogue: "I wasn\u2019t a big fan, but Grandpa always tried to get me excited
      about the books that he loved."
    speaker: Carl
  - dialogue: "Why didn\u2019t I see how hard he was trying? That he just wanted
      to connect with me?"
    speaker: Carl
  - dialogue: "I should have cherished that time while I had it. I\u2019d read all
      the science fiction in the world if it just meant that Grandpa Rick would come
      back."
    speaker: Carl
