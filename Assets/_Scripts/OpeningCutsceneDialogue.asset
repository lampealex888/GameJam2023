  - dialogue: "I don\u2019t wanna leave, Grandpa Rick. It\u2019s boring back at home.
      When I'm at your house we get to watch movies and eat lots of takeout and go
      out for ice cream all the time! But back at home all I get to do is take out
      the trash and clean my room.    "
    speaker: Carl
  - dialogue: "Carl, you coming to visit is the best part of my days. But, you know,
      at some point you have to go back home to your parents. They love you just
      as much as I do. \r\r"
    speaker: Grandpa Rick
  - dialogue: "Yeah but you don\u2019t make me do chores like they do."
    speaker: Carl
  - dialogue: 'Keep up the sass and I just might. '
    speaker: Grandpa Rick
  - dialogue: Grandpa Rick!
    speaker: Kid
  - dialogue: " Run along now. I\u2019m feeling pretty tired anyway. Being around
      youth like you really takes it out of me. "
    speaker: Grandpa
  - dialogue: Are you okay Grandpa? You do look a little pale.
    speaker: Kid
  - dialogue: "Oh I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m fine. Just feeling a little woozy I suppose.
      Must have overdone it a bit. Now head on home so I can get some shut eye. \r"
    speaker: Grandpa
  - dialogue: "Okay Grandpa. I\u2019ll see you next Saturday though, right? \r"
    speaker: Kid
  - dialogue: "But when I went back to Grandpa's house on Saturday, he wasn\u2019t
      there. He was just\u2026 gone. He promised. And Grandpa never breaks his promises.
      I knew that something was wrong. Wherever he was, I needed to find him! "
    speaker: Kid
